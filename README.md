So far these are implemented.

1) Basic rendering
2) Acceleration and braking physics
3) Meter board
4) Particle system ( For night sky and collision effects )
5) Lighting effects ( Directional Lighting and illuminating )
6) Blur
7) Reflections
8) Sounds

So far car accelerates and stops as a real car smoothly. Meter board is fully functional. When it comes to 
lighting you can clearly see the blue, illumination and reflections in the uploaded video. It's a bit too bright
when applied but other than that it works flawlessly. Network not implemented.
